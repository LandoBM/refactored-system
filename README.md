# C# Badge Maker - Cat Worx

## Description

C# Badge Maker is a CLI Application that allows users to generate ID badges pngs that include the employee name, id, and photo. It was built to learn C#.

While building this project I learned to:

- Manipulate the file system to generate files and folders
- Install C# packages using `dotnet`
- Import packages with the `using` tag. Primarily from the `System` and also from `dotnet` packages.
- Run a C# file by using `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch`

1. You will be asked if you would like to auto generate ids. If true 10 ids will be generated and placed within the `data` folder. If false continue reading.

3. Once you have finished entering one id you may either continue entering ids or simply hit enter with no input to finish. Ids will be generated and placed within the `data` folder.
